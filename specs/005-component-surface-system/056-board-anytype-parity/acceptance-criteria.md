# Acceptance Criteria: Board Anytype Parity

> This document decides whether the packet may close. A packet is closeable when
> every row below is `Met`, `Waived` or `Superseded`. A `Waived` or `Superseded`
> row MUST name an ADR that exists in `decision-record.md`.

## 1. METADATA

**Packet:** 005-component-surface-system/056-board-anytype-parity
**Level:** 3
**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-09-05
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:criteria -->
## 2. CRITERIA

One row per criterion. `AC-ID` is stable once written: supersede a criterion, never renumber it.
AC-001 through AC-009 align to REQ-001 through REQ-009. AC-010 is the operator's.

Desktop measurements are taken on the real renderer at the production mount point; phone
measurements on a 390x844 profile with a navbar present. Every threshold carries a failing value
observed on HEAD before the fix (goal D2), recorded in `checklist.md`. Exit statuses are read from
`$?` and never through a pipe.

| AC-ID | REQ | Given / When / Then | Verification | Status | Waiver |
|-------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| AC-001 | REQ-001 | **Given** the 62 kanban capture files on disk, **When** an image-capable leaf reads them px by px, **Then** all 13 anatomy elements are recorded in `design-trueup.md`, each with a capture filename and either a measurement or the **design inferred** label with its reason | T001's read. A measurement-only leg records "pixel read owed" rather than substituting a DOM reading (`054` ADR-005) | Unmet | - |
| AC-002 | REQ-002 | **Given** `spec.md` section 4's per-element migration table, **When** every row is filled, **Then** 0 cells read `unknown` and each of the 39 `pm-*` classes is either replaced or carries a written reason for staying | The table, read row by row | Unmet | - |
| AC-003 | REQ-003 | **Given** 39 constructed `pm-*` classes and 23 `pm-kanban-*` stylesheet rules on `3407dab0`, **When** the retarget lands, **Then** both counts reach 0 undispositioned survivors | `grep -o "pm-[a-z-]*" src/views/board-renderer.ts \| sort -u \| wc -l` and `grep -o "pm-kanban[a-z-]*" styles.css \| sort -u \| wc -l`, read directly | Unmet | - |
| AC-004 | REQ-004 | **Given** no sticky scrollbar exists on the board today, **When** the board is taller or wider than the viewport, **Then** a horizontal scrollbar renders 10px tall, 8px above the viewport bottom, full content width, within +/- 1px, with colours from the theme's scrollbar tokens | `050/design-trueup.md` REQ-003 for the captured geometry; measured after on the production render path. Anytype's `#B6B6B6`/`#EBEBEB` is declined with its reason: an Obsidian plugin lets the reader's theme own scrollbar chrome | Unmet | - |
| AC-005 | REQ-005 | **Given** 7 affordances gated behind `boardExtensions = false` (`board-renderer.ts:202-205`), **When** each is dispositioned, **Then** the count shipping default-off is 0 and each carries `retire` or `fold` | `rg -n "boardExtensions" src/views/board-renderer.ts`, plus the migration table's disposition column | Unmet | - |
| AC-006 | REQ-006 | **Given** `045`'s card-property mechanism, **When** its row presentation is retargeted, **Then** `board-card-properties-panel.test.ts` is green with 0 lines changed and the panel's public surface is unchanged | `git diff --stat src/views/board-card-properties-panel.test.ts` and the suite result. A test that needed editing means the mechanism broke rather than its presentation changing | Unmet | - |
| AC-007 | REQ-007 | **Given** 12 registered sheet surfaces and 31 registered stacked pairs, **When** the last leg lands, **Then** `sheet-grammar.mjs` still reports 12 and 31 green at exit 0 | `node tools/live/sheet-grammar.mjs`, exit read from `$?` | Unmet | - |
| AC-008 | REQ-008 | **Given** the kanban layout's captured page limit of 10, **When** the board applies a limit, **Then** it is 10, or our own number argued rather than cited | `anytype-menu-set-layout-kanban-page-limit-*`. `053` D4 withdrew `050`'s flat 60: the limit is per-layout, Gallery 60 and Kanban 10, absent elsewhere | Unmet | - |
| AC-009 | REQ-009 | **Given** T002's pre-leg `pm-gantt-*` count and gantt capture hashes, **When** every board leg has landed, **Then** both are identical or a move is explained by a named gap from this packet | T002 baselines, T010 re-reads. `037`'s in-repo parity was 60 of 60 classes with zero divergence at `30c4b746`. Never rebaselined silently | Unmet | - |
| AC-010 | OPERATOR | **Given** a release carrying the rebuilt board, **When** the operator opens it on iOS and on desktop beside Anytype, **Then** they report it as Anytype-shaped | The operator's own words. Nothing in this repository can close this row, and an agent never ticks it | Unmet | - |

### Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Met` | Verified. The Verification cell names evidence that was actually observed. |
| `Unmet` | Not yet satisfied. Blocks closure. |
| `Waived` | Deliberately not pursued. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |
| `Superseded` | Replaced by a different criterion or decision. Requires an ADR in the Waiver cell. |

### Waiver cell

Write `-` when the row is `Met` or `Unmet`. Write `ADR-NNN` when the row is `Waived` or
`Superseded`, naming a decision record that exists in `decision-record.md`. An unbacked waiver is
treated as an unmet criterion rather than as a pass.

## 3. CLOSURE STATEMENT

**Not closeable.** Ten rows, ten Unmet. The packet was authored 2026-09-05 ~22:45 on the operator's
board ruling and no task has run: T001's capture true-up is owed to an image-capable leaf and gates
AC-001 through AC-005 and AC-008; T002's red-first pass is owed and gates every figure; AC-010 is
the operator's and is closed by nobody here.

Shipped, verified and operator-confirmed are three states and only the third closes (parent D3).
